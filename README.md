Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project allows the user to enter an investment plan and returns projected growth based upon that plan.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I managed the user display pretty well.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe I could make my code more readable by making it less complex. By having less lines, the program would run more efficiently.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it challenging trying to make the user display how I wanted it, and overcame this through looking through resources online. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe learning how to manage the system output will be transferable to other projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable by placing different parts of the code in different files. This also makes the program more readable overall.
